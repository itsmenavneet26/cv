<ul>
<li>Tonight go to sleep as though your whole past has been dropped. Die to the past.<br>
   And in the morning wake up as a new man in a new morning.<br>
    Donâ€™t let the same one who went to bed get up. Let him go to sleep for good.
</li>
<li>
Sunrise and sunset are beautiful moments but you can't hold them.<br>
 Let things move. There will be more sunrises and sunsets
